> [!NOTE]
> **This is the [shuv1337/herdr](https://github.com/shuv1337/herdr) fork of [herdrdev/herdr](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr).**
> It tracks upstream `master` and adds fork-only changes such as shuvcode/shuvpi integrations, native jj workspaces, custom local machine labels, and the night-owl-gold theme.
> Each [release](https://github.com/shuv1337/herdr/releases) lists the fork's changes in its notes.
> Fork builds are versioned `<upstream-version>-shuv.<N>` (for example `0.9.1-shuv.1`), and `herdr update` installs updates from this fork's releases, not from herdr.dev.
> Report fork-specific problems [here](https://github.com/shuv1337/herdr/issues), not upstream.

**the runtime your coding agents live on.**

- **detach without stopping work** — herdr keeps terminals running in a background server when you close the client or lose your SSH connection. after a server or machine restart, herdr restores the saved layout and can resume supported agent sessions; the original processes do not survive. [session state →](https://herdr.dev/docs/session-state/)
- **several machines, one window** — keep local work and saved ssh machines together, with a combined agent list and independent reconnects. [remote machines →](https://herdr.dev/docs/connecting-machines/)
- **never hunt for the stuck one** — every pane is marked working, blocked, or idle. when an agent stops and needs an answer, herdr says so.
- **agent-native** — agents drive herdr through the cli and socket api: they can spawn panes, prompt each other, and wait until another agent is genuinely blocked. [agent skill →](https://herdr.dev/docs/agent-skill/)
- **runs what you already run** — claude code, codex, cursor, opencode, grok and the rest. herdr doesn't wrap or replace them; it owns their terminals.
- **keyboard and mouse, both first-class** — tmux-style prefix keys *and* click, drag, split. pick per moment, not per tool.
- **plugins** — extend panes and workflows. [browse the marketplace →](https://herdr.dev/plugins/)
- **one rust binary, no electron** — runs in whatever terminal you already use.

## install

install the fork on linux or macos:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/shuv1337/herdr/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

windows (powershell):

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://github.com/shuv1337/herdr/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex"
```

or download a binary from [releases](https://github.com/shuv1337/herdr/releases). the installer puts `herdr` in `~/.local/bin` (set `HERDR_INSTALL_DIR` to change that) and replaces any herdr already installed there. fork installs update with `herdr update`. this fork publishes stable releases only, so leave `herdr channel` set to `stable`.

`brew install herdr`, `mise use -g herdr`, Nix, and `https://herdr.dev/install.sh` install **upstream** herdr without the fork's changes. to switch back to upstream, run `curl -fsSL https://herdr.dev/install.sh | sh`.

then start it where the work lives:

```bash
herdr
```

run your agents, split panes, walk away. `ctrl+b q` detaches, `herdr` reattaches. [quick start →](https://herdr.dev/docs/quick-start/)

## agent instructions

if you are an ai agent helping with this repository, read [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) before making changes and read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening issues or PRs.

## development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shuv1337/herdr
cd herdr
cargo build --release

just test        # unit tests
just check       # formatting, tests, and maintenance checks
```

### fork releases

fork releases are built by [`.github/workflows/fork-release.yml`](.github/workflows/fork-release.yml) from `v<cargo-version>-shuv.<N>` tags. to publish one, push `master`, then run:

```bash
just fork-release            # tags origin/master as the next v<version>-shuv.<N> and pushes the tag
just fork-release --dry-run  # print the next tag without creating it
```

the workflow builds all five platform assets and attaches them to the GitHub release, along with `latest.json` (the update manifest `herdr update` reads) and the install scripts. after publishing, it posts a short announcement to Discord through the `DISCORD_RELEASE_WEBHOOK_URL` repository secret. if the secret is missing, it skips the post; if the post fails, the release still succeeds. it does not commit anything back to `master`, so syncing upstream won't conflict with fork releases.
